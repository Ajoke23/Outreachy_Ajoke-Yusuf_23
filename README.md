# Outreachy_Ajoke Yusuf_23
I am an excited to be part of outreachy contribution stage with Moja Global. This project is exciting for me 
because I am a strong advocate of SDG 13 which talks about climate action and Moja Global mission focuses on 
climate action via open source software. Over the years, I have witnesses how climate changes led to a 
disastrous effect in my community here in Lagos, Nigeria which Ignited my quest and keen interest for environmental
sustainability. 

Climate change is a global challenge that affects every aspect of human life. In Lagos, we are experiencing more
frequent and intense heat waves, which are affecting the health of residents. We are also experiencing more frequent
flooding, which is causing damage to infrastructure and property. These impacts are affecting the quality of life of
residents and the economic development of the city.

The impact of climate change is felt globally, and it affects every aspect of human life. Climate change is causing
sea levels to rise, which could lead to the displacement of millions of people in coastal regions. It is also causing
more frequent and intense weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and droughts. These events are affecting
agriculture, water resources, and human health, among other things.

To mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, we need to take a comprehensive approach. This includes reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and increasing the resilience of communities and 
ecosystems. We also need to invest in research and development of new technologies and practices that can help us to 
adapt to the changing climate.

In Lagos, we can take a range of measures to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. One key area is transportation. 
Lagos is a highly populated city with significant traffic congestion, which contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas
emissions. We also need to promote sustainable land-use practices, such as urban farming and green roofs, to increase the
resilience of our ecosystems.
